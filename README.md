🧠 PRODIGY_ML_02 - Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository contains my solution for Task-02 of the Machine Learning internship, where I performed Customer Segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm.

📌 Task Objective

Implement an unsupervised learning model using K-Means Clustering to group customers based on Annual Income and Spending Score.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

scikit-learn

📈 Workflow Summary

Data Loading

Imported Mall_Customers.csv and explored the structure.

Data Preprocessing

Selected key features: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100).

Elbow Method

Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (K).

K-Means Clustering

Applied KMeans from sklearn.cluster to segment customers.

Visualization

Plotted clusters using matplotlib and seaborn for clear interpretation.

📊 Output
Optimal clusters found using Elbow method
Visual representation of customer segments with distinct colors
Useful insights for targeted marketing strategies
